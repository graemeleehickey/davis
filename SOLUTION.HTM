Solutions to Homework Problems
</H1>

<font size=3>Solutions to selected homework problems are available as
a pdf file to course instructors.  Please contact Springer-Verlag to
obtain access to this file.

<DT>Please note that the solutions manual is not yet complete. 
Updates will be noted on this website.

<DT>Also, the solutions provided are not guaranteed to be correct.  I
did not prepare all of these myself (and even if I had, this would
still not guarantee that they are error-free).

<H3>  </H3>

<DT>Please report any corrections or clarifications to
chuck-davis@juno.com.  In addition, submission of partial or complete
solutions to problems for which solutions are not yet provided will be
greatly appreciated.  These can be provided in whatever format is most
convenient (e-mail text, word document, TeX or LaTeX, etc.)
