Transparencies
</H1>

<font size=3>The file <A HREF="transpar.zip"> transpar.zip</A>
contains 751 transparencies (pdf format) plus a table of contents
(microsoft word document).

<H3>  </H3>

<DT>The transparencies for each chapter are in separate files.  For many
chapters, there are two types of files.  Files named TRANxx.PDF
contain transparencies produced with magnification.  These can be
printed "as is" for use in making overhead transparencies to accompany
chapter xx.  In addition, using a postscript printer, it should be
possible to print these files four per page for use in making
handouts.  Files named OUTPUTxx.PDF contain computer output using a
smaller font and should be printed as is.

<H3>  </H3>

<DT>Pages are numbered sequentially from 1-751 across chapters.

<H3>  </H3>

<DT>Because some notational changes were made during the writing of
the book, there will not be perfect notational match between the book
and the transparencies.  I attempted to identify such differences, but
I am certain to have missed many.

<H3>  </H3>

<DT>Please report any errors or notational inconsistencies to
chuck-davis@juno.com.  I will note the dates on which corrections and
updates are made on this website.
